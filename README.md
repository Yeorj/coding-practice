# Competitive Coding Practice
This repo was created so I can keep track of my solutions while practicing competitive coding problems.

The reason I wish to keep track of my competitive coding problems is two-fold:
1. Entertainment/Fascination -
	* I find the problem solving aspects of competitive coding really enjoyable and understanding the use of algorithms and data structures to reduce runtime in problems is essential for creating effective code.
2. Interview Practice -
	* In McDowell's <i>Cracking the Coding Interview</i>, she goes into the importance of keeping up the interviewing skills. Even if I am satisfied with my current position it is vital that I keep my interview skills sharpen. I also know that interview/competitive code problems are the ones I stuggle with the most during interviews and I personally want to improve on them.

To practice my skills I have composed notes from YouTuber's, Errichto, [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBr_Fu6q9iHYQCh13jmpbrg) and have been doing practice problems from [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) which can be found in this repo.
